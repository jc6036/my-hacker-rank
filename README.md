A place for me to store solutions to HackerRank and Leetcode problems

I have solutions in multiple languages. Focusing on leetcode problems right now since I like their computer science and algorithmic focus, vs HackerRank which has more brain teasers.

I do NOT use GPT to generate my solutions, however I do use it to look up reference documentation when I can't find something. I also do not use GPT to provide any optimizations. If I achieve 90%+, I did it on my own. Important to note I'm out here to learn, not cheat my way through a leaderboard with GPT answers. Those answers have their place in a real code base, but that's not the intent of this repo.
